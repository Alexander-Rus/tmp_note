Hi Alex - 

I've done some digging for the project. It looks like we have until next Saturday at midnight (11/9) to turn this in. So for efficiency purposes, I am attaching the below:
My high level proposal of what we should do
This is a bullet point list I got from describing our project to gen AI and can be thought of as a project initial idea. I have comments throughout this document on how I specifically think we should implement our solution. Please review them when you have a chance and let me know if you agree or disagree with what I propose.

One of the sample proposals Yash posted to canvas
I think we should just follow the structure of this one i.e. we copy the section titles of this proposal as applicable and then fill in the information as it applies to our project. 
Since the deadline for this is a bit tight, I'm going to go ahead and propose the following division of labor for the proposal so we can just get straight to writing the proposal.
One of us covers the Overview / Related Work Section
One of us covers the Experimental Design / Timeline / Evaluation / Individual Responsibilities Section
Pick whichever one of the above works for you and I'll take the other. I don't have a preference. Just make sure you review my high level proposal and let me know if you agree with all of my thoughts as it relates to the Experimental Design section. Again since we're crunched for time, I think it would be most efficient if we just independently wrote our sections throughout the week as we have the ability, and then if there are any gaps between our two portions we can reconcile them at the end before submitting.



I completed my section - I'm attaching the final document with my work for your reference. I put it into the latex editor that we'll use for our submission. When you're ready you can just send me a document with all your parts and I can copy them into the latex editor also and append to my section. Let me know if that works for you and let me know if you have any questions on anything I've written. Again, no rush at all I just want you to have maximum visibility on everything I'm working on. If you need we can have a call and finalize but if you're on board with my sections I think you can just send them straight over to me and I can finalize / submit. I tried to get this done before the weekend because I will be busy both tomorrow and Saturday nights. So I just want to optimally consolidate and submit our work sometime on Saturday during the day (i.e. afternoon to early evening) if possible. If that doesn't work we can figure something else out though. Thanks as always and let me know if you need anything.




For now, again just to keep it simple, I would just send me your sections in a google doc and then we can consolidate in the end and put it into a nice overleaf document etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each proposal is expected to be 4 to 5 pages long + references. Each student should upload a PDF copy of the project proposal (submissions should be identical for students on the same team).

Elaborate on the “hows” to build the project.  This document should be long and fairly low-level.
